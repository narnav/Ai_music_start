# Music Genre Predictor 🎵

A simple Flask-based web app that predicts a user's preferred music genre based on age and gender. Users can also teach the system by submitting new data (age, gender, and genre), which is stored in a CSV file for future retraining.

The frontend is a dark-themed HTML page using Axios to communicate with the Flask backend.

## 🧰 Features

- Predict music genre based on age and gender.
- Learn new data: Users can add age, gender, and genre to the dataset (`music.csv`) for model improvement.
- Dark-themed UI.
- CORS enabled, allowing the frontend to run separately.
- Easily extendable for retraining the model (e.g., using scikit-learn and joblib).
